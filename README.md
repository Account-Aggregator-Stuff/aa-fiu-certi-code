### FIU/TSP Certification Module
This repository can be used to obtain FIU certification, which is required to use the Account Aggregator (AA) Framework API Specification as per the Sahamati Guidelines for AA and FIU. 

It will help you pass all the [test cases](https://github.com/Sahamati/certification-framework/blob/main/certification-scenarios/fiu.md) which is required to ensure adherence to technical standards in the AA ecosystem as per [v1.1.2](https://api.rebit.org.in/viewSpec/AA_1_1_2.yaml). 
If you need assistance with the certification process, or encounter any technical issues while setting up or running the code, please don't hesitate to contact us for support.

### The Account Aggregator Ecosystem

The Account Aggregator (AA) usage has been on the rise with 80MN consents requests successfully fulfilled till date. To put things into perspective, this number was not even 10MN a year back, which indicates a phenomenal growth in the overall usage of the network. 

As more Financial Information Providers (FIPs) onboard on the network, unlocking new use-cases, the adoption is only going to further increase.

#### Challenges Faced by FIUs

Having spoken to and worked with different Financial Information Users (FIUs) over the past few months, we have realised that there is a lot of information asymmetry in the ecosystem. Most regulated FIUs who want to use the AA network face a high barrier to entry due to multiple reasons. 

One of the most pertinent reasons which has stood out is the steep one-time onboarding charges which a FIU has to pay to be registered on the network. Sahamati which is the volunteer body looking after the AA ecosystem has laid down a bunch of technical standards (in the form of ReBit specs) which needs to be adhered to before being onboarded onto the network. Sahamati has appointed empanelled certifiers which are responsible for ensuring adherence to technical standards and certification of the FIU. 

Currently, the FIU certification is done by Technology Service Providers (TSPs), as a part of the onboarding process, but for a hefty sum of money. Most FIUs (like individual RIAs, 0-1 startups) are not able to afford the certification/onboarding fees and hence stay away from using the AA network.

### Our Solution

In an effort to eliminate these barriers and ensure smooth onboarding of FIUs on the AA ecosystem, we are open-sourcing the code which a FIU can use to get the certification done. 

The module is ready to use which means that the development time for the FIU (in case they were to develop it themselves) is reduced from a few months to 0, and the cost to get the certification done is reduced from a few lakhs (in case they were to use a TSP) to a few thousands. 

For the AA ecosystem to grow by leaps and bounds, more and more FIUs should use the network and build/innovate on top of it. 

In case you are an FIU, looking to get onboarded on the network, please check out the module. In case there are questions around the certification process, please feel free to reach out to us.
